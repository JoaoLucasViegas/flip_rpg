# |----- Disclaimer -------
# | I was trying to fix the previous implementation of the mobs/enemies but
# | ended up realizing it was "smarter" by remaking them instead of fix each 
# | part that was meant to be modular.
# | 
# | This is just a part of a code you might see later on in production. For now
# | it's just a sample for combats/attacks.
# | 
# | I tried fixing stuff so this was my first "implementation".
# | It might be used later on, just let us "fix" the movement and player recognition
# | on enemies/mobs or else it will be too "specific just for mobs.
# | 
# | This code is meant for modular purposes, so instead of making 1 source code
# | for each mob/entity on the game, make it all here and each element has it's own
# | use of this.
# | 
# | All the rest might be the same code I picked before.
